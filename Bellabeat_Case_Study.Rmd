# *1. Introduction*
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The company aims to use smart device data to improve marketing strategy and user engagement. This case study explores *how activity, sleep, heart rate, and weight impact calorie burn*, providing recommendations to enhance Bellabeat’s market strategy.

# *2. Data Preparation*
## *2.1 Datasets Used*
I used *5 datasets* from Fitbit smart devices:

- **Activity Data (dailyActivity_merged)** → Steps, activity intensity, and calories burned.  
- **Sleep Data (minuteSleep_merged)** → Duration and quality of sleep.  
- **Heart Rate Data (heartrate_seconds_merged)** → Heart rate levels over time.  
- **Intensity Data (hourlyIntensities_merged)** → Activity intensity measurements.  
- **Weight Data (weightLoginfo_merged)** → Weight, BMI, and fat percentage.  

## *2.2 Data Cleaning & Merging*
- Handled missing values (e.g., missing weight entries).  
- Converted date formats for consistency.  
- Merged datasets by **User ID (Id) and Date**.  



```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load required packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)

# Read cleaned dataset
merged_data <- read.csv("merged_data.csv")

# Check structure
str(merged_data)

3. Key Insights

3.1 Activity & Calories Burned

🔹 Finding: Activity intensity strongly impacts calories burned.

ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = DailyIntensity, y = Calories)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Activity Intensity vs. Calories Burned", x = "Daily Intensity", y = "Calories Burned")

✅ Higher activity intensity = more calories burned.
✅ Step count alone is a weaker predictor than intensity.

3.2 Sleep & Calories Burned

🔹 Finding: Sleep has no strong correlation with calorie burn.

cor(merged_data$TotalSleepMinutes, merged_data$Calories, use = "complete.obs")

❌ No strong impact (-0.07 correlation).
🔹 However, good sleep improves recovery and motivation to exercise.

3.3 Heart Rate & Calories Burned

🔹 Finding: Moderate impact on calorie burn.

cor(merged_data$AverageHeartRate, merged_data$Calories, use = "complete.obs")

✅ Higher heart rate slightly increases calorie burn (0.28 correlation).

3.4 Weight & Calories Burned

🔹 Finding: Weak impact of weight on calories burned.

ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = WeightKg, y = Calories)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Weight vs. Calories Burned", x = "Weight (Kg)", y = "Calories Burned")

✅ Weight has a weak correlation (0.37) with calorie burn.
✅ Activity intensity matters more than weight alone.

4. Business Recommendations

🔹 1. Shift Marketing to “Active Minutes” Instead of Step Goals
	•	Market “high-intensity workouts” for weight loss and fitness tracking.
	•	Introduce “Active Minutes Goals” instead of step count.

🔹 2. Introduce a “Heart Rate Efficiency Score”
	•	Help users understand how effectively they burn calories at different heart rates.

🔹 3. Expand Sleep & Recovery Coaching
	•	Provide personalized sleep recommendations based on daily activity levels.

🔹 4. Develop Personalized Calorie Burn Predictions
	•	Combine activity intensity + heart rate for better calorie tracking.

5. Conclusion & Next Steps

Bellabeat can leverage data-driven insights to enhance its product offerings and marketing strategy:
✅ Activity intensity, not just steps, determines calorie burn.
✅ Heart rate data can improve workout efficiency tracking.
✅ Personalized fitness coaching will improve user engagement.

Next Steps:
🔹 Implement smart coaching features.
🔹 Market Bellabeat as a personalized health optimization tool.
🔹 Expand insights into other lifestyle factors (hydration, stress tracking, etc.).
