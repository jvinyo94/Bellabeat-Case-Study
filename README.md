# 📊 Bellabeat Case Study: Data-Driven Insights  
## 🏆 Case Study Objective  
Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, aims to expand its market.  
This analysis explores *how activity, sleep, heart rate, and weight impact calorie burn* to guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.  

---

## 📂 Datasets Used  
✔ dailyActivity_merged.csv – Steps, activity intensity, calories burned.  
✔ sleepDay_merged.csv – Sleep duration and quality.  
✔ heartrate_seconds_merged.csv – Heart rate levels over time.  
✔ hourlyIntensities_merged.csv – Activity intensity.  
✔ weightLoginfo_merged.csv – Weight, BMI, and fat percentage.  

---

## 🔎 Key Insights  
✔ *Activity Intensity vs. Calories Burned:* Higher intensity leads to more calories burned.  
✔ *Steps vs. Calories Burned:* Steps alone are a weak predictor of calorie burn.  
✔ *Heart Rate vs. Calories Burned:* Moderate correlation; higher heart rate slightly increases calorie burn.  
✔ *Sleep vs. Calories Burned:* No strong relationship, but quality sleep may aid motivation.  
✔ *Weight vs. Calories Burned:* Weak correlation; activity matters more than weight alone.

## 📊 Visualizations  
The analysis includes:  
✔ Scatter plots (Activity Intensity vs. Calories Burned, Weight vs. Calories Burned).  
✔ Bar charts (Activity Levels Breakdown).  
✔ Histograms (Calories Burned Distribution).  

## 📊 Charts Description 
1️⃣ Activity Levels Breakdown

📌 Chart Title: Breakdown of Activity Levels
📊 Description:
This bar chart categorizes users’ activity levels into different intensities, such as sedentary, lightly active, fairly active, and very active. It provides an overview of how users distribute their time across these activity levels.

🔹 Key Insights:
	•	The majority of users fall under the sedentary or lightly active categories.
	•	Very few users spend a significant amount of time in the very active category.
	•	This trend suggests a need for increased physical activity to improve overall fitness.

2️⃣ Activity vs. Calories Burned

📌 Chart Title: Relationship Between Activity Intensity and Calories Burned
📊 Description:
This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between activity intensity and the number of calories burned. It helps assess whether higher activity levels result in increased calorie expenditure.

🔹 Key Insights:
	•	A positive correlation is observed—higher activity intensity generally leads to more calories burned.
	•	Some users with moderate activity levels still burn high calories, possibly due to longer exercise durations.
	•	Encouraging more intense and prolonged physical activity could help users burn more calories.

3️⃣ Calories Burned Distribution

📌 Chart Title: Distribution of Calories Burned
📊 Description:
This histogram displays the distribution of calories burned across users, helping to identify common calorie-burning ranges.

🔹 Key Insights:
	•	Most users burn between 1,500 and 3,000 calories per day.
	•	Some outliers burn significantly more, likely due to high activity levels or extended workouts.
	•	The distribution suggests that while some users maintain active lifestyles, others may require increased movement to boost calorie expenditure.

4️⃣ Steps vs. Calories Burned

📌 Chart Title: Daily Steps vs. Calories Burned
📊 Description:
This scatter plot explores the relationship between the number of steps taken and the calories burned.

🔹 Key Insights:
	•	There is a positive correlation—more steps generally lead to higher calorie burn.
	•	However, some users burn high calories with fewer steps, possibly due to other physical activities or metabolic differences.
	•	Increasing step counts through walking and movement-based exercises can be beneficial for maintaining fitness.

5️⃣ Daily Intensity Boxplot

📌 Chart Title: Boxplot of Daily Intensity Levels
📊 Description:
This boxplot visualizes the distribution of users’ daily activity intensity levels, helping to identify median, quartiles, and outliers.

🔹 Key Insights:
	•	The median intensity level shows that most users have moderate activity levels.
	•	There are outliers representing users with extremely high activity levels.
	•	The spread suggests that while some users are highly active, many remain in the lower intensity range, emphasizing the need for increased daily movement.

6️⃣ Weight vs. Calories Burned

📌 Chart Title: Weight vs. Calories Burned
📊 Description:
This scatter plot examines the relationship between users’ weight and their daily calorie expenditure.

🔹 Key Insights:
	•	A slight upward trend suggests that heavier individuals tend to burn more calories, likely due to higher energy requirements.
	•	However, some lower-weight individuals still burn high calories, indicating differences in activity levels.
	•	This insight reinforces that calorie burn is influenced by both weight and physical activity levels.
