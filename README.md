# 📊 Bellabeat Case Study: Data-Driven Insights into Activity & Lifestyle  

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This case study explores how *activity levels, sleep, heart rate, and weight* impact *calorie burn* using smart device data. The insights will help *Bellabeat*, a wellness company, optimize its marketing and product strategy.  

## 📂 Dataset  
I analyzed *5 datasets* from fitness trackers:  
- *Activity Data* (dailyActivity_merged.csv) → Steps, intensity, calories burned  
- *Sleep Data* (minuteSleep_merged.csv) → Duration & quality of sleep  
- *Heart Rate Data* (heartrate_seconds_merged.csv) → Heart rate trends  
- *Intensity Data* (hourlyIntensities_merged.csv) → Activity intensity  
- *Weight Data* (weightLoginfo_merged.csv) → Weight, BMI, and fat percentage  

## 📊 Key Findings  
✅ *Higher activity intensity = more calories burned*  
✅ *Step count alone is a weak predictor of calories burned*  
✅ *Sleep has no strong correlation with calorie burn*  
✅ *Heart rate has a moderate impact on calorie burn*  
✅ *Weight has a weak impact on calorie burn*  

## 🔥 Business Recommendations  
🚀 *Focus on Active Minutes* instead of step goals  
📈 *Introduce a Heart Rate Efficiency Score* to improve calorie tracking  
💤 *Expand Sleep & Recovery Coaching* for better user engagement  
📊 *Develop Personalized Calorie Burn Predictions*
