## 🔎📊 Updated Key Findings

1️⃣ Higher Activity Levels Lead to More Calories Burned
	•	Users with 400+ daily intensity points burn an average of 3,000-4,000+ calories.
	•	Those with under 200 intensity points typically burn below 2,500 calories.

2️⃣ Daily Steps and Calories Burned Show a Moderate Relationship
	•	Users walking 5,000–10,000 steps burn approximately 2,000–3,000 calories.
	•	Step count alone isn’t enough; intensity and duration play a bigger role.

3️⃣ Weight Alone Does Not Strongly Impact Calorie Burn
	•	Some users weighing 70 kg burned over 3,500 calories, while others at the same weight burned under 2,000 calories.
	•	Activity level is a stronger factor in calorie burn than weight.

4️⃣ Activity Levels Are Not Evenly Distributed
	•	The majority of users record less than 5 minutes of very active time daily.
	•	Only a few reach 25–55 minutes, suggesting low engagement in high-intensity workouts.

5️⃣ Calorie Burn Distribution Shows a Right Skew
	•	Most users burn around 2,000 calories daily, but a few outliers exceed 3,500 calories due to high-intensity activities.

🔹 Overall Recommendation: Bellabeat should promote high-intensity activities rather than just increasing steps. Customized workout plans can gradually raise users’ activity levels for better calorie burning.

## 📊 Visualizations  
The analysis includes:  
✔ Scatter plots (Activity Intensity vs. Calories Burned, Weight vs. Calories Burned).  
✔ Bar charts (Activity Levels Breakdown).  
✔ Histograms (Calories Burned Distribution).  

## 📊 Charts Description 
1️⃣ Activity Levels Breakdown

📌 Chart Title: Breakdown of Activity Levels
📊 Description:
This bar chart categorizes users’ activity levels into different intensities, such as sedentary, lightly active, fairly active, and very active. It provides an overview of how users distribute their time across these activity levels.

🔹 Key Insights:
	•	The majority of users fall under the sedentary or lightly active categories.
	•	Very few users spend a significant amount of time in the very active category.
	•	This trend suggests a need for increased physical activity to improve overall fitness.

2️⃣ Activity vs. Calories Burned

📌 Chart Title: Relationship Between Activity Intensity and Calories Burned
📊 Description:
Activity vs. Calories → “This scatter plot shows the relationship between activity intensity and calories burned. I observe that as activity levels increase, calorie expenditure also rises, indicating a direct correlation.

🔹 Key Insights:
	•	A positive correlation is observed—higher activity intensity generally leads to more calories burned.
	•	Some users with moderate activity levels still burn high calories, possibly due to longer exercise durations.
	•	Encouraging more intense and prolonged physical activity could help users burn more calories.

3️⃣ Calories Burned Distribution

📌 Chart Title: Distribution of Calories Burned
📊 Description:
This histogram displays the distribution of calories burned across users, helping to identify common calorie-burning ranges.

🔹 Key Insights:
	•	Most users burn between 1,500 and 3,000 calories per day.
	•	Some outliers burn significantly more, likely due to high activity levels or extended workouts.
	•	The distribution suggests that while some users maintain active lifestyles, others may require increased movement to boost calorie expenditure.

4️⃣ Steps vs. Calories Burned

📌 Chart Title: Daily Steps vs. Calories Burned
📊 Description:
This scatter plot explores the relationship between the number of steps taken and the calories burned.

🔹 Key Insights:
	•	There is a positive correlation—more steps generally lead to higher calorie burn.
	•	However, some users burn high calories with fewer steps, possibly due to other physical activities or metabolic differences.
	•	Increasing step counts through walking and movement-based exercises can be beneficial for maintaining fitness.

5️⃣ Daily Intensity Boxplot

📌 Chart Title: Boxplot of Daily Intensity Levels
📊 Description:
This boxplot visualizes the distribution of users’ daily activity intensity levels, helping to identify median, quartiles, and outliers.

🔹 Key Insights:
	•	The median intensity level shows that most users have moderate activity levels.
	•	There are outliers representing users with extremely high activity levels.
	•	The spread suggests that while some users are highly active, many remain in the lower intensity range, emphasizing the need for increased daily movement.

6️⃣ Weight vs. Calories Burned

📌 Chart Title: Weight vs. Calories Burned
📊 Description:
This scatter plot examines the relationship between users’ weight and their daily calorie expenditure.

🔹 Key Insights:
	•	A slight upward trend suggests that heavier individuals tend to burn more calories, likely due to higher energy requirements.
	•	However, some lower-weight individuals still burn high calories, indicating differences in activity levels.
	•	This insight reinforces that calorie burn is influenced by both weight and physical activity levels.
