## 🔎 Key Insights  
✔ *Activity Intensity vs. Calories Burned:* Higher intensity leads to more calories burned.  
✔ *Steps vs. Calories Burned:* Steps alone are a weak predictor of calorie burn.  
✔ *Heart Rate vs. Calories Burned:* Moderate correlation; higher heart rate slightly increases calorie burn.  
✔ *Sleep vs. Calories Burned:* No strong relationship, but quality sleep may aid motivation.  
✔ *Weight vs. Calories Burned:* Weak correlation; activity matters more than weight alone.
